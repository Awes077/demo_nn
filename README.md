This repo is still a work in progress. Feel free to reach out if you have questions!

This project applies some machine learning techniques to demographic inference in population genomics. In a nutshell, I use simulated site-frequency-spectra (SFS) from msprime under different demographic models to train neural networks in PyTorch (in the Two Epoch model script) and boosted regression trees in Scikit-learn (in the Boosted regression tree notebook). In general, both approaches are able to infer parameter values well under a two-epoch model. At the moment, neural networks struggle to learn to infer parameters under a three-epoch model, while boosted regression trees tend to do a better job at the moment. I'm still tweaking a number of elements of both the simulations and model defintions, so the current performance shouldn't be considered final.
